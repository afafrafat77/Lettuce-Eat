                This place is a real find - friendly staff, fresh food and at a really good price. Ask for the buffet at $13.50 and you really can have 'all you can eat'. There's sashimi, chicken katsu, tempura prawns, and the usual salmon rolls, calafornia rolls etc to munch on, along with miso soup. The place is often busy but they always find room for us - it's a regular haunt because it's such good value, and a great place to take friends who've not tried sushi before as the staff are happy to explain what's what if needed. Definately worth a visit!

                I am a HUGE fan of great sushi and I've eaten at many of London's sushi restaurants. I'm fortunate in that I can eat quite frequently at Koi as it's become my favorite of all sushi restaurants. The quality is fantastic every time, unlike other sushi restaurants. It's just as good take away as well. I highly suggest the dragon roll with it's fresh ingredients, the seaweed salad is almost like a dessert, the salmon sashimi has that buttery fresh taste to it. My girlfriend loves the tofu. One of my favorites is the prawn tempura cut roll...of which I could eat to my hearts content.

                This place is absoloutely delicious! If you want a lovely chinese meal with fantastic service that is always friendly then this is definately the place to go! A few of my favouriteds are their ribs (to die for) and the duck is also always perfect! the atmosphere is always cool and relaxed and it is by far the nicest chinese i've ever had! It is not cheap, but....definately worth the money you pay!

                This is my favourite restaurant in the whole world! I never go anywhere else for Japanese... I absolutely recommend this place to anyone - the Japanese food is exceptional - service and presentation are second to none. I recommend a teppanyaki set - choices are endless and include meat and seafood but if that does not entice you, the fresh and exquisite sushi is also just as wonderful! Particularly worth mentioning is the Dragon sushi- it will make a long lasting impression on any guest.

                The sashimi and nagiri are both fresh and copious, and the price... $6.50 gets you all the sushi you can manage, plus udon or ramen noodles, chicken teriyaki, and even a chicken katsu! If anyone knows of a better place to have sushi in Europe
